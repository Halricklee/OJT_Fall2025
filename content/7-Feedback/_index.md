### Overall Evaluation

**1. Work Environment**  
The work environment at AWS is welcoming and inclusive. Colleagues are always willing to provide guidance and support whenever I encounter challenges. The workspace is well-equipped and conducive to focus. I think it would be even more engaging if there were more team activities or knowledge-sharing sessions across departments.

My mentor are always serious and are always be to help the interns. The admin team facilitated all administrative tasks efficiently, allowing me to focus on learning and project work.

**3. Alignment with Academic Knowledge**  
The tasks assigned during my internship connected well with what I studied at university, while also exposing me to technologies and tools I had never used before. For example, working with Amazon OpenSearch helped me understand real-world search and analytics solutions.

**4. Learning and Skill Development**  
Throughout the internship, I enhanced my programming, data analysis, and log analytics skills. I also learned professional communication and teamwork. The mentor shared practical insights that helped me better plan my career in cloud computing.

**5. Company Culture and Team Spirit**  
AWS fosters a culture of respect, collaboration, and learning. Team members support each other during tight deadlines, and the environment encourages sharing ideas openly. Even as an intern, I felt like a valued part of the team.

**6. Internship Policies and Benefits**  
The program provides a stipend, flexible working hours, and access to internal training resources. These benefits made it easier for me to focus on gaining meaningful experience.
