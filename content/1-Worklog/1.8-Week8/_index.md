## Week 8 Goals (Oct 27 – Nov 2, 2025)

- Explore **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** for deploying web applications.  
- Learn to deploy, update, and monitor applications.  
- Understand environment configurations, scaling options, and health monitoring.  
- Practice integrating Beanstalk with RDS and S3 for a full-stack application.

## Achievements

- Gained hands-on experience deploying applications using Elastic Beanstalk.  
- Configured environment settings, auto-scaling, and load balancing.  
- Successfully integrated RDS and S3 for a full-stack web application.  
- Learned update, rollback, and monitoring strategies for production-ready deployments.

## Reflection

Week 8 improved my understanding of PaaS on AWS. Elastic Beanstalk simplified deployment and management, while integration with RDS and S3 allowed me to build a complete application stack. Practicing updates and rollback enhanced confidence in managing production environments.
