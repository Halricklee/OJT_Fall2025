## Week 10 Goals (Nov 10 – Nov 16, 2025)

- Explore **AWS Lambda** and serverless computing in depth.  
- Learn to create, test, and deploy Lambda functions using Python.  
- Understand triggers from **S3, CloudWatch, and API Gateway**.  
- Practice logging, monitoring, and handling errors in Lambda.

## Achievements

- Gained hands-on experience creating and deploying Python Lambda functions.  
- Learned to use S3 and API Gateway as event sources for Lambda.  
- Configured logging, monitoring, and alarms for error detection.  
- Practiced building serverless APIs and event-driven workflows.

## Reflection

Week 10 deepened my knowledge of serverless architecture on AWS. Lambda allowed me to deploy scalable functions without managing servers, while integration with S3, CloudWatch, and API Gateway provided practical experience in event-driven cloud solutions.
