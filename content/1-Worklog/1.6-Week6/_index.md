## Achievements

- Gained solid understanding of CloudFormation templates and stack management.  
- Successfully created reusable, modular templates with parameters and outputs.  
- Learned to handle resource dependencies and safely update stacks.  
- Familiar with best practices for template versioning and organization.

## Reflection

Week 6 enhanced my ability to manage AWS infrastructure programmatically. Using CloudFormation improved efficiency and repeatability, which is crucial for large-scale cloud projects. Understanding dependencies and stack updates gave me confidence in deploying complex environments safely.
