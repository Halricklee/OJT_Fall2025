## Achievements

- Understood EC2 instance types and their proper use cases.  
- Successfully launched EC2 instance and connected via SSH.  
- Gained hands-on experience with VPC configurations.  
- Learned different S3 storage classes and applied lifecycle policies to manage objects effectively.  

## Reflection

Week 2 deepened my understanding of AWS compute and networking services. Working with EC2 and VPC gave practical insights into cloud infrastructure, while S3 lifecycle management showed how to optimize storage costs.
