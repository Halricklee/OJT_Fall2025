## Week 3 Goals (Sep 22 – Sep 28, 2025)

- Explore **AWS Lambda** and serverless computing concepts.  
- Learn how to create Lambda functions and integrate with other AWS services.  
- Understand **API Gateway** and how to expose Lambda via REST APIs.  
- Practice monitoring Lambda performance and logs using **CloudWatch**.

## Activities & Tasks

| Day | Description | Start | End | References |
| --- | ----------- | ----- | --- | ---------- |
| Monday, Sep 22 | Studied serverless architecture and use cases for AWS Lambda. | 22/09/2025 | 22/09/2025 | [AWS Lambda Docs](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) |
| Tuesday, Sep 23 | Created first Lambda function in Python, tested basic execution, explored console and CLI options. | 23/09/2025 | 23/09/2025 | [Lambda Getting Started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/) |
| Wednesday, Sep 24 | Integrated Lambda with S3 events to trigger execution on object upload. | 24/09/2025 | 24/09/2025 | [S3 Event Triggers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/) |
| Thursday, Sep 25 | Explored API Gateway: created REST API, connected it to Lambda, tested endpoints. | 25/09/2025 | 25/09/2025 | [API Gateway Docs](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) |
| Friday, Sep 26 | Learned to monitor Lambda using CloudWatch logs, set alarms for errors and execution time. | 26/09/2025 | 26/09/2025 | [CloudWatch Docs](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) |

## Achievements

- Understood serverless concepts and AWS Lambda workflow.  
- Successfully created and tested Lambda functions triggered by S3 events.  
- Exposed Lambda functions via API Gateway REST endpoints.  
- Practiced monitoring Lambda logs and setting CloudWatch alarms for proactive alerts.  

## Reflection

Week 3 provided practical experience in serverless development. Combining Lambda with S3 and API Gateway gave insight into building event-driven, scalable applications without managing servers. Monitoring with CloudWatch ensures reliability in production environments.
