## Week 5 Goals (Oct 6 – Oct 12, 2025)

- Dive deeper into **AWS S3**: advanced features and security.  
- Understand **bucket policies, ACLs, and encryption options**.  
- Practice versioning, replication, and lifecycle rules.  
- Learn to integrate S3 with **Lambda** and other AWS services for automation.

## Activities & Tasks

## Achievements

- Mastered S3 security features including policies, ACLs, and encryption.  
- Practiced versioning and lifecycle management to optimize storage.  
- Automated workflows by connecting S3 events to Lambda functions.  
- Gained confidence in designing secure and efficient S3-based solutions.

## Reflection

Week 5 enhanced my understanding of advanced S3 features and their practical applications. Integrating S3 with Lambda demonstrated the power of automation in cloud storage workflows, while lifecycle and versioning taught cost-effective data management.
