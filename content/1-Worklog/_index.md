**On this page**, you will find my comprehensive 12-week AWS learning journey worklog. This program was designed to build foundational to advanced AWS cloud computing skills through hands-on practice with First Cloud Journey (FCJ) workshops.

**How did I complete it?** 
I followed a structured learning path from September 9, 2025, focusing on practical labs and real-world scenarios. Each week consisted of 5 days (Monday to Friday) of intensive learning, with 10-15 hours dedicated to hands-on practice, documentation reading, and project implementation.

**Program Duration:** 12 weeks (3 months)

**Learning Approach:**
- 60% hands-on practice with AWS services
- 30% reading AWS documentation and FCJ workshop materials
- 10% completing exercises and reviewing best practices

**What did I accomplish?**

Throughout this 12-week program, I progressively built expertise across 25+ AWS services, starting from account setup to deploying production-ready, highly available applications. Below is the weekly breakdown:

**Week 1:** [AWS Fundamentals - Account Setup, Billing, Support, and IAM](1.1-week1/)

**Week 2:** [AWS Networking - VPC, Subnets, Security Groups, and AWS CLI](1.2-week2/)
