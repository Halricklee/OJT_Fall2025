## Week 4 Goals (Sep 29 – Oct 5, 2025)

- Learn about **DynamoDB** and NoSQL database concepts.  
- Practice creating tables, inserting data, and querying with different key types.  
- Understand **primary keys, sort keys, and indexes** in DynamoDB.  
- Explore integration of DynamoDB with Lambda for serverless applications.

## Achievements

- Learned key concepts of DynamoDB and NoSQL data modeling.  
- Successfully created tables and performed CRUD operations.  
- Applied partition keys, sort keys, and secondary indexes in queries.  
- Integrated DynamoDB with Lambda for event-driven serverless workflows.

## Reflection

Week 4 provided practical experience in building scalable NoSQL applications on AWS. DynamoDB’s integration with Lambda helped me understand event-driven architecture and reinforced my knowledge of serverless database interactions.
